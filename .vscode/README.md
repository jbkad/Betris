# Betris
Bootleg Tetris

Problems

#P1
- Tetrominos come out larger than gameboard, and doesnt align with the grid.
Possible Reasons:
- Difference in html coding - the code given in the tutorial is substituted. This is because the tutorial code doesn't work when run, failing to detect both js and css.
-  I may have missed a line of code or misinterpreted it in a way for me to understand, which has maybe logged into the console incorrectly.
- The image formatt may not be small enough to align with the gameboard grid, therefore coming out bigger than expected.
Solution:
- Resizing the shapes into 26 px x 26px in order to fit inside the grid correctly.
- Adding individal square.png images so that the 4 tetris pieces can also function independently.

#P2
- Tetris shapes does not free fall anymore.
Possible Reasons:
- May have added the control code(allows player to move shapes left/right) incorrectly, which has therefore disabled the free fall feature. This is because it was working fine until the control code was added.
